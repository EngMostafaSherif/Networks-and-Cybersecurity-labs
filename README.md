A repo of all my computer networking and Cybersecurity labs and projects

[Lab 1](https://github.com/EngMostafaSherif/Networks-and-Cybersecurity-labs/blob/main/Lab%201.jpeg): My little LAN (Note: no .pkt was saved so I uploaded the lab as a picture to my LinkedIn)

[Lab 2](https://github.com/EngMostafaSherif/Networks-and-Cybersecurity-labs/blob/main/Lab%202.pkt): Basic University VLAN configuration with trunking. [(Guide)](https://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/sites/default/files/lab05_vlan.pdf) (Note: In the guide, There's a mistake in step 11: the IP address of 172.17.20.22 is already taken, so try any other IP address from 172.17.20.2 to 172.17.20.254 except 172.17.20.22 and 172.17.20.25 because these IP addresses are taken by PC2 and PC5Â respectively)

[Lab 3]([https://github.com/EngMostafaSherif/Botium-Toys-Security-Audit](https://github.com/EngMostafaSherif/Networks-and-Cybersecurity-labs/blob/main/Lab%203.pdf)): Botium Toys security audit (A small security audit of a fictional company)
